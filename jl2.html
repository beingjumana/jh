    <h1>A LETTER TO THE SWEETEST MOM
      <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>
    </h1>
    <p>

      Dear Mom,<br/><br/>
      There’s no bond like a bond between mother and child. You know me in ways no one else ever will.<br/>
      <i>You understand me so well that we speak and think same.</i><br/>
      You also see in me all the things I can still become and continue having faith that I can do and be whatever I want, no matter what my age.<br/>
      You are my biggest fan, my mentor,my bestie and the first person I call to tell when things are going great or wrong .<br/>
      The comfort that comes from our friendship,<br/>

      and your unquestioning support of whatever I do, is irreplaceable.<br/>
      I wear your unconditional love and support around me like a big hug every single day.<i>
        I am so blessed to have you in my life.</i>
      Thank you for always, always being there in every situation.
      <br/>

      I hope you break 100 with good health and a strong mind. There’ll never be a day in my life when I won’t need you. I’m here for you too. Please remember that.<br/><br/>
      <b>Happy, Happy Happiest Birthday Mommie.</b>
      <br/>You make the world a better place.<br/>
      Love you always,
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Your lovely Daughter</b>
